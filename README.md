# world_happiness

The world happiness report is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness that ranks approximately 156 countries by how happy their citizens perceive themselves to be. It was first published in 2012 and continues to release a new report each year. Based on the reports from 2015 to 2019, we checked to see which countries consistently remain the happiest over these five years. 

So what makes citizens perceive themselves to be happy or not? Does money really make the world go round or is there more to it? 

Throughout this analysis we will be looking at: six measurable categories contributing to a happiness score, the correlation of those categories to a happiness score, industry leading experts scores to explain life evaluations that were over or underexplained by the other categories, the happiest and least happiest countries, and the highest scoring countries in individual categories.
